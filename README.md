# PACMAN-Game-OPENAI-GYM
This PACMAN game is a static random input generator game which uses the random actions to make the agent to move around, as the monster are static.

I am only generating 5 steps but the steps are updated if the steps are wasted in passing through walls, so the count of steps are not updated. Hence the count updates only when the game has the agent moving in all direction rather than walls.

The monster are static, but in next update of the program, with a new file name, the agent and the monsters will be moving and the human would be able to play the game...
WAIT FOR IT.

Till then you can use the current code for playing the game with random actions.
